    <p>Out of all the available subjects to learn about, IP addresses and Geolocation seemed the most interesting to me, and it's something that I've wanted to try and understand on a deeper level. 
      In order to learn more about this subject, I looked at the Lifewire article discussing the uses and practicality of geolocation. I learned that IP addresses can be be used to find out someone's location through geolocation, although the results are not always accurate. 
      I then proceeded to use whatismyipaddress.com to find out my own IPv4 address and learn the difference between and IPv4 address and a IPv6. A IPv4 address is the standard IP version, and is shorter in length, while a IPv6 address is a newer formatted IP address that is longer in length. 
      My own computer does not use a IPv6, as I found out, since it wasn't detected using the given websites.
      This information could be difficult to apply to my own work, but through my research I found out that website creators use geolocation information to find their demographic, and can even automatically change their site to show content based on where the visitor lives, such as showing store location near their area or town. 
      This has some general use, although I'm not entirely sure how I can utilize and make use of it.</p>
