    <title>Assignment 5 - Communications</title>

  <body>
    <p>For my assignment, I read through a webpage that discussed various different internet services on tutorialspoint.com, as listed under the Wikiversity "Internet Services" activity. 
      While reading through the page, I learned more about Communication Services, Information Retrieval Services, Web Services, the World Wide Web, and Video Conferencing. 
      Communication Services exchange information with individuals or groups, things such as emails, mailing lists, and newsgroups. 
      Information Retrieval Services offer easy access to information on the internet, things like File Transfer Protocol. 
      Web Services allow various applications to exchange information on the web, letting them easily interact with each other. 
      The World Wide Web lets you access and navigate between documents on the internet. 
      Video Conferencing allows audio and visual transmission feed communication between multiple people via telecommunication technologies.
      While I'm not sure if I can use any of this information yet, knowing about Web services and communication services will most likely help with creating and managing a website, either for commercial use or casual.</p>

    <p>Using HTML was eye-opening, and I really learned a lot while using it. 
      I learned and applied a lot of techniques for creating a website  while coding on Github, and I now know how to add links, bold text, add headings, and customize a website to my liking. 
      Through creating tags and adding text, I created a proper homepage and redesigned the layout of my website, allowing others to view the other assignments that I worked on during this course. 
      Knowing all of this, I can use this knowledge to create and customize my own webpages, which is extremely useful. 
      I can create artwork showcases, or a portfolio, or I can use this to display and share information to a broad group or audience.</p>
