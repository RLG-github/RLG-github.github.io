      Assignment 6b - CSS/HTML Management
    </h1>
     <p>
       While working with HTML, I found out how to structure and add text and links to a website. 
       I typed up and posted various webpages to display my previously created assignments, and then put together an index page where all of them can be viewed and read through. 
       I also learned how to add images to websites, through uploading an image to the website's online folder and linking it in the site's code. 
       This is something I will absolutely be applying in the future, as I can apply this knowledge to create and format webpages in order to share information, or even to make a gallery to show off art or other things to people online.

       While working with CSS, I learned how to change various visual aspects of a website's fonts, backgrounds, and layout. 
       I learned how to create an external style sheet in order to apply these visual changes to all pages at once, which saves the time of having to go back and change them each individually. 
       I can apply this knowledge for designing and polishing up websites in order to make them more visually appealing, which is something that I will absolutely be attempting in the future.
