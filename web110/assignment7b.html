      While working on my assignment, I learned how to utilize SQL in order to access and manipulate databases. 
      Using SQL allows me to know the specific information and details about who visits my website, allowing me to make adjustments and changes in order to best appease and fit the needs of people who browse it. 
      It also allows me to know what my current audience is, letting me know what best fits their needs.
