    <p>
      While completing these activities, I learned how to add raster/vector images, audio files, and YouTube videos to my webpages. 
      I uploaded a transparent PNG of a logo I created for a different project and added that to my assignment 7a page, alongside the downloaded sound_5.mp3 file from the website linked in the assignment directions. 
      I also embedded a study song mix from YouTube onto my website, it's something I listen to while working on homework and assignments. 
      I'll be able to utilize this knowledge and experience in the process of making and polishing a website, in order to showcase videos that either myself or others have uploaded. 
      I can also compile my music that I've composed and created on a website for convenient listening.
