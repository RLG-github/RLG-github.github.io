  <p>I learned a lot during in the process of making this presentation. I used a program that I've never learned before in order to make my slideshow, I add captions to a youtube video for the first time, I researched HTML, CSS, and JavaScript on various different websites. I learnt how to manage my time while creating a project like this, I learned more information about the subject I was writing on, HTML, alongside CSS and JavaScript. I can hopefully use these skill later on in the future, as working with HTML was really enjoyable!</p>

     <p>Today, I will be presenting a slideshow about HTML, and various aspects of it.

Here is the list of contents that I will be discussing over the course of the presentation. I will be going over HTML and how it works, HTML elements, coding platforms, HTML structure, declarations, tags, JavaScript, and CSS.

So, what is HTML? Hyper Text Markup Language, or HTML, was invented in 1991, and has been the standard code for building websites for a number of years. Using HTML, you can add text, images, videos, audio tracks to a website, and arrange their placement, size, and much more.

How does HTML work? When you load up a webpage, your browser reads the HTML document and displays them according to their code. The various HTML elements are read and displayed accordingly, embedding videos, images, and formatting paragraphs. This code isn't visibly shown by browsers, only interpreted by them.

What exactly are HTML elements? They are the building blocks of every single HTML-built webpage, providing a way to structure and add images, audio, and videos to a web page. An HTML element is defined by a starting tag, some content, and an ending tag.

There are a number of ways to code a website using HTML. Github is a reliable option, providing a variety of tools to help with programming and uploading your site. But even Notepad++, a program that comes with most Windows computers, is capable of performing the bare minimum in terms of coding. Github is developed for use with Windows, Mac, and Linux. Its clean and straightforward interface makes it easy to locate various HTML editing tools, open a new file, and search documents. Notepad++ is A free, open-source HTML editor developed for Windows-based computers. The program is lightweight and comes with a straightforward user interface.

Here is the basic structure of an HTML page. In order to define the code as an HTML 5 document, the <!DOCTYPE html> tag will allow the code to be read as such. The <html> tag is the root element of the page, and always encompasses all other elements. The <head> tag contains meta information about the HTML page, and the <title> tag specifies a title, shown on the browser's title bar. <h1> defines a large text heading, and <p> defines a text paragraph.

Tags are used to define different elements of a website, from headings and text, to images and videos. Tags <h1> through <h6> are used to create text headings, with each number up being a smaller size. The <b> tag is used to create bolded text, for added emphasis in words or headings. The <i> tag is used to create italic text, for similar reasons. The <pre> tag is used to preserve a paragraph's format, allowing line breaks to be viewed instead of reformatted. The <img> tag can be used alongside the "scr" attribute to embed an image into a webpage. The <a> tag can be used to create a hyperlink, using the "href" attribute to specify the link. The attributes width="x" and height="x" are used to set an image's width and height, where x is the desired size.

While JavaScript is normally used to create applications, it can also be used to create interactable elements in a webpage. JavaScript was originally made for use with HTML, but has since branched off, with it being used to make applications and servers. JavaScript can be used to create things like browser games, pop-up advertisements, and other interactable web elements

Cascading Style Sheets, or CSS, is used with HTML, to help describe how elements on a page are to be displayed. You can change the font, text size and color, background color, and much more with using CSS. If you have a website with a large amount of pages that you wanted to stylize by changing their text or background color, External CSS can be utilized to make your work easier, letting you change the look of an entire website by making changes to only one file. By creating a style sheet and adding a reference to it in each page you intend to stylize, you can change the appearance of many pages at once, without having to go back and adjust the code for each and every page.

Here are some examples of CSS tags that are used to change the appearance of various visual aspects of a web page. The body tag specifies the adjustments to be made towards the website's main body. The h1 and p tags do the same, though for h1-sized headings and paragraph text respectively. The background-color tag allows you to change the color of the site's background to whatever you specify it to. The text-align tag changes the text alignment for whatever you specify it to be on the webpage. The font-family tag allows you to change a text's font, whether it's paragraph or heading text. And finally, the font-size tag allows you to change the size of a text's font, effectively letting you change your text size.

In the end, HTML is important to how most websites on the internet work. Having knowledge on what it is and how it works is helpful for that very reason. Hopefully, you've learnt a little more than what you knew before, or at least enjoyed my presentation on HTML. Thank you so much for listening!
