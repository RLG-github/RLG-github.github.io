    <p>For my first assignment, I decided to research and learn more about emails through the resources and websites that were listed on the Wikiversity lesson "Complete the following tutorials", those being "Email Basics Tutorial" at edu.gcfglobal.org and "Electronic Email Basics" at tutorialspoint.com. 
While reading the first tutorial, I learned about how email websites can allow you to utilize your contact book, your calendar, and some even have an instant messenger service available. 
      While reading the second tutorial, I learned about CC and BCC. 
      The former stands for Carbon Copy and allows a copy of the email to be sent to someone who isn't the original recipient, while the latter stands for Black Carbon Copy, functioning almost identically with exception that the BCC recipient will not be listed or shown, allowing you to send it to someone else's email without exposing their address.
I feel like I can utilize this when organizing my assignments for school, since I can organize emails from my teachers. I can also use the calendar tool to organize when my assignments will be due.</p>
    
    <p>For my second assignment, I learned more about social media sites using the information provided by TutorialsPoint, as linked on Wikiversity. 
      I took a look at some of the largest social media sites and read about the benefits and uses of social media networking. 
      Sites like Facebook allow you to create a page for a specific project or community, while sites like LinkedIn let you get connected with professionals in job environments, who can help you find a career. 
      I already use some social media sites, but I might try to branch out and try different sites in order to make use of all the tools that they offer. 
      LinkedIn might be especially helpful in the future for finding a job to continue my career.</p>
