    <p>For my assignment, I decided to research and learn more about emails through the resources and websites that were listed on the Wikiversity lesson "Complete the following tutorials", those being "Email Basics Tutorial" at edu.gcfglobal.org and "Electronic Email Basics" at tutorialspoint.com. 
While reading the first tutorial, I learned about how email websites can allow you to utilize your contact book, your calendar, and some even have an instant messenger service available. While reading the second tutorial, I learned about CC and BCC. The former stands for Carbon Copy and allows a copy of the email to be sent to someone who isn't the original recipient, while the latter stands for Black Carbon Copy, functioning almost identically with exception that the BCC recipient will not be listed or shown, allowing you to send it to someone else's email without exposing their address.
I feel like I can utilize this when organizing my assignments for school, since I can organize emails from my teachers. I can also use the calendar tool to organize when my assignments will be due.</p>
