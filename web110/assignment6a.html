      I want to make a presentation describing HTML and how to code websites using it. 
      I'm going to use Google Slides in order to achieve this, and record my screen to create my recording. 
      I'm considering using text-to-speach in order to record my lines, but I might attempt to record them myself if I have time leftover after finishing my slideshow.

      Writing out the steps for completion helps with planning more than I ever thought it could. 
      Having each step completed on a different day or within a set amount of days helps spread out the workload, rather than attempting to complete everything within the span of a day or two. 
      If I can stick to this schedule, manage my work properly, and apply this strategy to my work process, then I can get this project done within a reasonable time frame without getting overwhelmed or having to rush everything last minute.
