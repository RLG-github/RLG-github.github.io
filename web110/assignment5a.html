    <p>HFor my assignment, I read through a webpage that discussed various different internet services on tutorialspoint.com, as listed under the Wikiversity "Internet Services" activity. 
      While reading through the page, I learned more about Communication Services, Information Retrieval Services, Web Services, the World Wide Web, and Video Conferencing. 
      Communication Services exchange information with individuals or groups, things such as emails, mailing lists, and newsgroups. 
      Information Retrieval Services offer easy access to information on the internet, things like File Transfer Protocol. 
      Web Services allow various applications to exchange information on the web, letting them easily interact with each other. 
      The World Wide Web lets you access and navigate between documents on the internet. 
      Video Conferencing allows audio and visual transmission feed communication between multiple people via telecommunication technologies.
      While I'm not sure if I can use any of this information yet, knowing about Web services and communication services will most likely help with creating and managing a website, either for commercial use or casual.</p>
