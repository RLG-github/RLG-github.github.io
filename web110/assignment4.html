    <p>For my first assignment, I researched Internet Reference Models, Internet Protocols, and the Internet Domain Name System through the links provided by the Wikiversity Networks page, under the lesson "Complete the following tutorials".
The Internet Reference Model page talked about the OSI (Open System Interface) model and the TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol and Internet Protocol) model, talking about the different layers that the OSI and TCP/IP models consists of. 
      The TCP/IP model combines several layers together, unlike the OSI model, and has fewer layers as a result. 
      The Internet Protocols pages talked about various internet protocols that exist, including the previously mentioned TCP and IP. 
      IP is considered to be an unreliable protocol, due to it not guaranteeing a successful data transmission, and it is paired with TCP in order to combat this. 
      The pages also discusses UDP (User Datagram Protocol), FTP (File Transfer Protocol), TFTP (Trivial File Transfer Protocol), and HTTPS (Hyper Text Transfer Protocol). 
      UDP is unreliable for the same reasons as IP, and gets paired with TFTP. The Internet Domain Name System page talked about IP addresses, URLs and URL types, and the Domain Name System Architecture. 
      IP addresses are an address assigned to a machine, and always are a specific length and pull numbers from within a specific range of numbers. 
      A URL (Uniform Resource Loader) refers to a web address identified as a document on the internet. 
      The Domain Name System Architecture is a system comprised of Domain Names, Domain Name Spaces, and Name Servers. 
      Domain Names are a string associated with an IP address, with some being generic like com, edu, and org, and others being abbreviated country level names. 
      The Domain Name Space is a hierarchy of domains with levels of priority being given to different domains, ranging from 0 to 127. Name servers contain the DNS database, comprised of various names and IP addresses.
While I did learn a lot from reading these pages, I have no idea on how to apply this information to my work. 
      I might be able to finally see the significance in IP addresses and various internet models, and make a website accordingly to my needs with this new information. 
      But besides making a website or an online advertisement, I'm not sure where else I can apply this knowledge to.</p>
    
 <p>For my second assignment, I visited the websites linked on Wikiversity under the lesson "Review IP address settings for your local network", and reviewed the network settings for my computer. 
   Some of my results might be different from what normally is supposed to happen, since my computer can't connect to Wi-Fi wirelessly yet due to not having the right parts installed, so I have it hooked up via ethernet cable. 
   I messed with my settings, setting my IP settings to Manual instead of Automatic, allowing me to manually set my IP and DNS server addresses. 
   Most of this activity was done using the command prompt window, where I typed in various commands in order to view my IP, my DNS history, and to purge my DNS history as instructed on the Wikiversity page. 
   I could unfortunately not complete the DHCP Options activity, for technical reasons. 
   I learned more about how the command prompt works, and about how to check my own IP and DNS information. 
   While I can't think of many ways to use this information, I know for a fact that this will be useful for finding out information about my computer that wouldn't be listed anywhere in the general computer settings. </p>
