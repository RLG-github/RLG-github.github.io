    <title>Session 2 - Web Browsers/Search Engines</title>

    <p>For my first assignment, I decided to research and test out the various different browsers that were listed on the Wikiversity lesson "Practice using web browsers". I already had Microsoft Edge predownloaded on my computer, so I downloaded Google Chrome, Firefox, Opera, and Brave. I found that all of the browsers had add-on and browser extension support, some even allowing extensions from other platforms (Brave's extensions worked off of the Chrome Web Store). All browsers had the ability to customize their appearance and colors, though some could only do so through the use of external official services, like the Chrome Web Store. Opera had several interesting features that I didn't see in any of the other browsers, mostly quality-of-life related things. It has a screenshot button, various ways to organize tabs and currently opened sites, and even a music player. Out of all the sites I used during the course of this assignment, Opera is the one that impressed me the most, and one that I'll definitely use more in the future. The tools it provides will absolutely help me out for class-related work and organization. The improved tab sorting features will help me with keeping my tabs neatly organized, being able to minimize irrelevant tabs and group together all of my school-related ones. The pins feature can help me pin school-related notes and lists to my new tab page.</p>

    <p>For my second assignment, I decided to adjust and manage the settings of various browsers that were listed on the Wikiversity lesson "Configure browser settings". Like before, I used Microsoft Edge, Google Chrome, Firefox, Opera, and Brave. I also checked out the various features of these browsers by reading the Help Center pages provided by Wikiversity. Opera, Brave, and Firefox offered VPN and anti-tracking guards, with Opera and Brave even having adblockers. Some browsers, like Opera, offered heavy amounts of customization in their settings menu, letting me permanently add or remove various UI elements and features, like removing the news section of the new tab interface. In the future, I think I'm definitely going to use Opera more often. I mentioned most of my reasons in my first assignment summary, but it mostly boils down to the sheer number of quality-of-life features and settings that are available. I can see myself making use of these features and settings in my school life to keep track of notes and assignments, as well as websites that we'll be commonly using.</p>
